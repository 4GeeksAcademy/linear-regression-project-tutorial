## üå±  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read this instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on [machine learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate) by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template).
2. Open the recently created repostiroy on Gitpod by using the [Gitpod button extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).
3. Once Gitpod VSCode has finished opening you start your project following the Instructions below.

## üöõ How to deliver this project

Once you are finished creating your linear regression model, make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to upload the repository link.

## üìù Instructions

**Predicting the medical insurance cost per person**:

(Description of the dataset)

Columns

- age: age of primary beneficiary

- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

- smoker: Smoking

- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

**Step 1:**

The dataset can be found in this project folder as 'bank-marketing-campaign-data.csv' file. You are welcome to load it directly from the link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/linear-regression-project-tutorial/main/medical_insurance_cost.csv), or to download it and add it to your data/raw folder. In that case, don't forget to add the data folder to the .gitignore file.

Time to work on it!

**Step 2:**

Use the explore.ipynb notebook to find patterns and valuable information.

Don't forget to write your observations.


**Step 3:**

Now that you have a better knowledge of the data, in your exploratory notebook create a first linear regression model with your data, in order to predict the insurance prima.

Choose a metric to measure your results.

**Step 4:**

Hypertune your model to improve your results.

Use the app.py to create your final machine learning modeling pipeline. 

Save your final model in the 'models' folder.

In your README file write a brief summary.
